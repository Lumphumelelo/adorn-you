		</p>
		<p>
			Yes MY angel, Mine all Mine
		<br>
			With a face so fine
		<br>
			A body like wine
		<br>
			A soul so kind
		<br>
			Truly a gem that’s a rare to find
		</p>
		<p>
			Theres never a day you don’t occupy my mind
		<br>
			Your name’s is forever present like a whisper the world cant unwind
		<br>
			When I miss you I wander through the memories we’ve designed
		<br>
			It’s the only time it feels good to be behind
		<br>
			 in a world that stays moving forward
		</p>
		</p>
			Baby I adore you
		</p>
		<p>
			I adore the way you move, the way you handle yourself , your smile, your presence and the
		<br>
			ever-present sparkle in your eye’s that naturally gravitates the keys of my soul to yours
		</p>
		<p>
			I adore the amazing girl your mother has raised, the girl you are now, I adore your dreams
		<br>
			the ones you whisper and the ones you fear to speak aloud
		<br>
			because each one reveals a piece of the extraordinary woman you’re becoming.
		</p>
		<p>
			I adore you at your highest and happiest moments and I will continue to adore you at your 
		<br>
			lowest and saddest as well
		</p>
		</p>
			I adore the strength you don’t always see in yourself
		<br>
			the courage tucked between your breaths and
		<br>
			the kindness you give so freely even when you feel empty.
		</p>
		<p>
			I adore you in every version of yourself  that I know and will get to know
		</p>
		<p>
			who you are now and who you’re blossoming into
		<br>
			because every chapter of you is worth loving.
		</p>
		<p>
			And no matter how the days shift or how the storms try to sway you,
		<br>
			my heart will remain steady in one truth:
		<br>
			I adore you.
		</p>
